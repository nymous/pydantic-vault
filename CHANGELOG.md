## [Unreleased]


## [0.7.2] - 2023-02-07
Thank you @ingvaldlorentzen for your contribution!

### Fixed
- Fix `TypeError` breaking Pydantic defaults when Vault returns `None` (#13)


## [0.7.1] - 2021-09-02
### Changed

- Add an example for dynamic paths in secrets


## [0.7.0] - 2021-08-16
Let's drop the "beta" version marker!

### Added
- Log discovered configuration to help debugging, see the "Logging" section in the Readme

### Changed
- Bump minimum `hvac` version to 0.10.6 instead of 0.10.0, to actually support AppRole authentication, and support the recently released 0.11.0
- Clarify documentation about authentication methods priority, and document a workaround for Pydantic big file size


## [0.6.0b0] - 2021-07-16
First beta release! ðŸŽ‰ Beware of the breaking changes listed below!

### Added
- Support any secret engine, not just KV v2 (#11)
- Support loading a whole secret at once as a dict if you don't specify the `vault_secret_key`
- Add examples for KV v1, KV v2 and Database secret engines
- Add test coverage

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Require explicit full secret path (#11)
  This enables support for all secret engines instead of just KV v2, and allows you to use different secret engines in the same settings class.
  To migrate, add `secret/data/` in front of all your `vault_secret_path` (replace `secret/` with your KV v2 mount point), and remove the now unused `vault_secret_mount_point` config. For example:
  ```python
  # Before
  class Settings(BaseSettings):
      db_username = Field(
          ...,
          vault_secret_path="my-api/prod",
          vault_secret_key="db_username",
      )

      class Config:
          vault_secret_mount_point: str = "secret"


  # After
  class Settings(BaseSettings):
      db_username = Field(
          ...,
          vault_secret_path="secret/data/my-api/prod",
          vault_secret_key="db_username",
      )
  ```
  See the examples in the readme for more information.
- **BREAKING**: Invert the priority of environment variables and Config values (config now overrides what is set in environment variables)
